# Selector Policy (Front-End Contract)

Every interactive element must have data-testid (or data-cy).
Format: kebab-case, stable, not business copy. Examples:
- login-submit
- order-row
- toast-error

Required on: inputs, buttons, links, rows, modals, toasts.
Do not remove or rename data-testid without QA review.
